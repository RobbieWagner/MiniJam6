  alertBody:
  - <color=#7072ffff>Welcome, employee <b>224937</b>, to your new role here at <b>NORTH
    EAST BETA AIRLINES</b>. We are excited to have you  aboard!</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>As an <b>AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OPERATOR</b>, your role is especially
    important. After all, a dead customer is not a paying one!
  - <color=#7072ffff> We at <b>NORTH EAST BETA AIRLINES</b> understand the importance
    of the customer's <s>money</s> satisfaction. That's why, to keep track of your
    performance, we will be using the customer's satisfaction as a direct metric.
  - <color=#7072ffff>If you wish to avoid <b><color=red>DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS</color></b>,
    you will need to be cautious of your performance and reception. Keep the customer
    happy, and you will do just fine.
  - <color=#7072ffff>But how do we keep the customer happy? Here at <b>NORTH EAST
    BETA AIRLINES</b>, you will have the power and responsibility to control our
    patented <b>REMOTE OPERATED PLANES</b> to do just that.
  - <color=#7072ffff>The <b>STALL FLIGHT</b> button on the left of each aircrafts
    control card will temporarily force the plane to circle its current location.
    During this time, the plane will not collide with anything.
  - <color=#7072ffff>This has little impact on customer satisfaction, so it will
    be an easy way to prevent two planes from getting too close.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>In some situations, however, this is not enough. This is where
    the <b>REROUTE BUTTON</b> comes in. Located on the of the control card, this
    button will allow you to select a new destination for the plane to travel before
    continuing towards its destination.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>Simply push the <b>REROUTE BUTTON</b>, then select any point
    on the map, and the plane will travel there.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>The customer does not like this as much, so satisfaction will
    be affected, and it can only be used once per flight, but it will be necessary
    at times to prevent crashes this way.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>That is all for now. Thank you for your attention, and welcome
    aboard. <b>NORTH EAST BETA AIRLINES</b> is glad to have you!</color>
