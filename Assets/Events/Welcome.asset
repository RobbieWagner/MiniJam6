  - <color=#7072ffff>Welcome, employee <b>224937</b>, to your new role here at <b>NORTH
    EAST BETA AIRLINES</b>. We are excited to have you come aboard!</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>The following pages are meant to introduce you to your new role,
    and help you to better ease into the position. If you already know how the role
    works, please feel free to skip through them.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>As an <b>AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OPERATOR</b>, your task will be
    to monitor flights, and prevent them from crashing. To do this, you will have
    two options for controlling our <b>remote operated aircrafts</b>:</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>The <b>STALL FLIGHT</b> button on the left of each aircrafts
    control card will temporarily force the plane to circle its current location.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>This has little impact on customer satisfaction, so it will
    be an easy way to prevent two planes from getting too close.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>In some situations, however, this is not enough. This is where
    the <b>REROUTE BUTTON</b> comes in.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>Located on the of the control card, this button will allow you
    to select a new destination for the plane to travel before continuing towards
    its destination.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>Simply push the <b>REROUTE BUTTON</b>, then select any point
    on the map, and the plane will travel there.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>The customer does not like this as much, so satisfaction will
    be affected, and it can only be used once per flight, but it will be necessary
    at times to prevent crashes this way.</color>
  - <color=#7072ffff>That is all for now. Thank you for your attention, and welcome
    aboard. <b>NORTH EAST BETA AIRLINES</b> is glad to have you!</color>
