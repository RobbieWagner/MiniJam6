  alertTitle: M.J. Destroys Asia!
  alertBody:
  - Megazilla Jr., son of infamous Megazilla. Is rampaging in China after his father
    told him he couldn't go to the school dance. Says MJ "My dad is being, like,
    so totally unfair!"
  - '"Chelsea is going to be there, and if I can''t go then Brad is gonna like totally
    steal her from me!" '
  - Says dad "I have no idea where my son got the idea that he <i>could</i> go to
    a school dance. He's twice the size of the whole school, so he'd crush the gymnasium!"
  - Avoid contact with this teenage tantrum at all costs. Mainly because the planes
    will crash into him, but also because it is really annoying to the passengers.
