  alertBody:
  - Hello employee 224937. Thank you for stepping up and taking charge with yesterday's
    events. I know you may have been confused or even alarmed, so I wanted to take
    some time to make some clarifications for you.
  - Most employees here at <color=#7072ffff><b>NORTHEAST BETA AIRLINES</b></color>
    are not briefed until they have been with us for at least a week, but with recent
    events we decided to advance sooner.
  - In your role as air traffic control associate, your job is to ensure the safety
    of our <b>remote operated aircraft</b>, but that is not your only responsibility.
    In truth, there are many things the average citizen is not aware of.
  - That giant squid, for instance, comes out of the blue, much to the shock and
    horror of anyone who witnesses it. That is why, starting today, we will be promoting
    you to <b>Conspiracy Control Associate</b> effective immediately.
  - As more anomalies come up, you will be taking charge to ensure the safety, and
    also the ignorance, of many of our flyers. More information will come as events
    arise, so for now just continue the same work as before.
  - Thank you.
